To Compile:
	
	$ gcc ques[1/2].c turing_machine.c -o output

To Execute:
	
	$ ./output [size_of_turing_tape]


size_of_turing_tape is optional parameter, by default the program takes tape size 1000, mentioned in each program using #define.

About STRING/INPUT:
	
	Pattern string can be changed in both prog at line np. 9.


Ques1:
    Algo:

    	1) Convert No.s to unary reps.
    	2) Now once we have unary reps of both no. start subtracting 2nd num from 1st until 1st < 2nd
    	3) Finally we will have unary rep of answer
    	4) convert unary rep to binary


Ques2:
	Algo:
		1) Leave the first number rep. no. of vertices
		2) For all rows
			2a) count no. of ones in row and add after input
			2b) overwrite 1's for each i.e. for eg. 1st row has 2 1's and 2nd row has 3 1's then 1st we will get 11 at the 	end of input, for 2nd we will just overwrite first 2 ones and add 3rd 1.
			2c) Now we will have unary rep of ans. copy this ans after head of tape
		3) convert unary to binary.


***All operations are done using single tape only.
